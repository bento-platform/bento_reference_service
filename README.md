# Bento Reference Service

Reference data (genomes &amp; annotations) service for the Bento platform.

## Goals

* Provide a well-known location for genomic reference materials within Bento nodes - both human and non-human
* Provide a translation service for looking up annotations, returning responses 
  containing genomic coordinates for genes, exons, etc.
* Facilitate node-level ingestion of reference genomes
* Implement the [RefGet v2.0.0](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/refget.html) specification for obtaining sequence 
  data

## Status

* Bento-style genome ingestion: **DONE**
* API endpoint permissions: **DONE**
* RefGet v2.0.0 implementation: _Partially done_
* Annotation service: _Partially done_
* Tests: _Partially done_
* Documentation: **Not done**
